# Roadway-Grading-Design
Directions

1.	Input the design Parameters (Grading Limit, Elevation Change Limit, Cross Slope Limit, Lane Width, & Road Length) in the Input Parameters sheet	

2.	Copy and paste Flow Line data (Station & Elevation) from CAD into the Left, Right, and Center sheets and format the data under the Existing columns	
	
	2a)	Adjust the number of rows needed to include the data and adjust the referenced cells for the scatter plots as needed
	
	2b)	Adjust the Left, Right, and Center Line elevations under the Proposed columns as needed to meet grading requirements in the Left, Right, and Center sheets, respectively 

3.	Copy the Proposed Left and Right Flow Line data (Station & Elevation) into the Cross Slope Center Design sheet	
	3a)	Match the Stations that can be compared between the Left, Right, and Center Lines and delete the unmatched data
	
	3b)	Input the matched Left and Right Flow Line data into the corresponding Proposed Left and Proposed Right columns and the Adjusted Center Line elevations will update based on the Cross Slope Limit parameter

4.	Copy the Adjusted Cetner Line data (Station & Elevation) into the Cross Slope Left & Right Design sheet under the Proposed Center columns and the Adjusted Left and Adjusted Right Flow Line elevations will update based on the Cross Slope Limit parameter	

5.	In the Averages sheet, the average elevations between the Left, Right, and Center Lines taken from the Cross Slope Center Design and Cross Slope Left & Right Design sheets is shown under the Averages column	
	
	5a)	Under the Matching Left and Right Elevations columns, the average between the Left and Right Flow Line elevations at each corresponding station is taken to provide equal elevations for both sides of the roadway

6.	Copy the Left and Right Flow Line elevations under the Matching Left and Right Elevations columns and paste the values into the Left (2) and Right (2) sheets, respectively under the Proposed columns to perform a second iteration for the gradings	
	
	6a)	Adjust the number of rows needed to include the data and adjust the referenced cells for the scatter plots as needed
	
	6b)	Adjust the Left and Right Flow Line elevations as needed to meet grading requirements in the Left (2) and Right (2) sheets, respectively and keep track of the elevation changes for the corresponding stations in order to attempt to match elevations between the Left and Right Flow Lines

7.	Copy the Proposed Left (2) and Right (2) Flow Line data (Station & Elevation) into the Cross Slope Center Design (2) sheet	
	
	7a)	Match the Stations that can be compared between the Left, Right, and Center Lines and delete the unmatched data
	
	7b)	Input the matched Left (2) and Right (2) Flow Line data into the corresponding Proposed Left (2) and Proposed Right (2) columns and the Adjusted Center (2) Line elevations will update based on the Cross Slope Limit parameter

8.	Copy the Adjusted Cetner (2) Line data (Station & Elevation) into the Center (2) sheet under the Proposed columns to perform a second iteration for the gradings	
	
	8a)	Adjust the number of rows needed to include the data and adjust the referenced cells for the scatter plots as needed
	
	8b)	Adjust the Center Line elevations as needed to meet grading requirements and keep track of the elevation changes for the corresponding stations

9.	The Station and Elevation data in the Existing vs Proposed sheet under All Points will automatically update 	
	9a)	Copy the Station and Elevation data for the Left, Right and Center Lines under All Points and match the Stations that can be compared between them. Delete the unmatched data
	
	9b)	Paste the matched Station and Elevation data for the Left, Right and Center Lines intot he corresponding tables under Matching Points
	
	9c)	Adjust the number of rows needed to include the data and adjust the referenced cells for the scatter plots as needed
